The following are summary notes relating to creating a standalone http
based application.  These were assembled during the creation and installation
of this application.

  I. Http Server Library
   1.0 Install libmicrohttpd-0.9.37 (or equivalent)
       a) You must build on a BBB (generally from nfs shared fs)
       b) Thereafter you can just do a "make install" from nfs mounted/built

   2.0 You must add /usr/local/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       a) export LD_LIBRARY_PATH='/usr/local/lib'

 II. Readonly Root Filesystem
   1.0) These notes conducted using 192.168.0.4
       a) Angstrom v2012.12
       b) BBB rev B

   2.0 Update /etc/fstab to change root ro and mount others as tmpfs
       a) See sample fstab-ro 
       b) To write to root remount as rw using:
           mount -o remount,rw /

III. Allow custom http server
   1.0 Disable existing BBB web services (may be using port 80)
     systemctl disable cloud9.service
     systemctl disable gateone.service
     systemctl disable bonescript.service
     systemctl disable bonescript.socket
     systemctl disable bonescript-autorun.service
     systemctl disable avahi-daemon.service
     systemctl disable gdm.service
     systemctl disable mpd.service

III. Auto start as a service
   1.0 Well documented on web, see Scripts/brec-start.sh files
   2.0 Check status with
       systemctl status brec-start.service
