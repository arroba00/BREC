The following are summary notes relating to creating a standalone http
based application.  These were assembled during the creation and installation
of this application.

I. Http Server
   1.0 Install libmicrohttpd-0.9.37 (or equivalent)
       a) You must build on a BBB (generally from nfs shared fs)
       b) Thereafter you can just do a "make install" from nfs mounted/built
   2.0 You must add /usr/local/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       a) export LD_LIBRARY_PATH='/usr/local/lib'

II. Instrument - Readonly Root Filesystem
   0.0) These notes conducted using 192.168.0.4
        a) Angstrom v2012.12
        b) BBB rev B

   1.0 Update /etc/fstab to change root ro and mount others as tmpfs
       - Based on google forumns (Thanks Dieter W) 
       - See sample fstab
       - To write to root remount as rw using:
           mount -o remount,rw /

   2.0 NOTES:
       a) Accessing uEnv.txt
           mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/card
            - Does not appear to be a need to modify this (?)
       b) sysfs/gpio access on ro root
            - I had no problem starting Wbsvr on ro root
            - verified R board leds on channel selection
       c) Networking setup scripts do not work with ro root

III. Auto start as a service
   1.0 Well documented on web, see Scripts/brec-start.sh files


TODO
1) figure out how to disable existing port 80 server (show BBB material)

systemctl disable gateone.service
systemctl disable bonescript.service
systemctl disable bonescript.socket
systemctl disable bonescript-autorun.service
